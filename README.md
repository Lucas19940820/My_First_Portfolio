### 1. Basic Structure (base_index.html)
- Created a valid HTML file containing `DOCTYPE`, `head`, and `body` sections.
- Validated the file using the W3C Validator.

### 2. Cool First Webpage (index.html)
- Added 4 paragraphs, headings (h1, h2, h3), and a clickable image.
- Linked the image to a chosen URL.

### 3. Cool Other Webpage (tweets.html)
- Embedded a tweet and added navigation links between `index.html` and `tweets.html`.

### 4. Consistent Website Structure
- All pages (`index.html`, `tweets.html`) now have the same structure:
  - `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` sections.
  - Navigation links in the header, and a placeholder in the `<aside>`.

### 5. Added Creativity (index.html)
- Added a table with learner information using the `<table>`, `<thead>`, and `<tbody>` tags.

### 6. Personal Portfolio Webpage (portfolio/index.html)
- Created a personal portfolio page showcasing skills, projects, and contact information using semantic HTML5.
